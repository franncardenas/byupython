Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

I was able to see the power of functions in one of the assignments this semester, 
when we were able to develop functions that contained very complex formulas within them.

2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

I think they are necessary just to help us see the different errors that 
our program may have, and they also allow us to test what we are developing.


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

Well, first I try to understand what I want to achieve with the function, 
then I look at the error it has if it gives me a clue to the problem, 
and if it is a known error I fix it, if I don't know what error it is 
I look it up on the internet so I can get more guidance on that error. 
To improve I could investigate more about the python functions or modules 
that are being used. Another one could be to use the VSC Debug.
